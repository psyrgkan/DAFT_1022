I am Panos

I am from Grecia/Griechenland/Je suis Greque or something
I am a college student
I am studying Applied Math and Computer Science, hence my experience

I am here to learn the tools and build a portfolio

The intensity and the experience
Presentation, GitHub, Visualization, Time-management, Project-management

Go back to school to finish my studies

Tech, env-tech, energy technology
Hopefully a mix of practical skills and theoretical/mathematical knowledge and modelling/research
I am not sure at all
